# Synerise AI Research

We are an AI lab that aims at exploring the field of behavioral modeling. We work on our proprietary algorithms for 
event data embedding and graph processing on large-scale data. We make effort to automate repeatable parts of the 
process.\
\
Here, we want to share our ideas embedded in code and step-by-step tutorials with various use cases 
of our algorithms.
